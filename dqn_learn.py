            # Pytorch will differentiate this error for you, to backward the error use the following API:
            #       current.backward(d_error.data.unsqueeze(1))
            # Where "current" is the variable holding current Q Values and d_error is the clipped bellman error.

            # Note: don't forget to call optimizer.zero_grad() before the backward call and
            #       optimizer.step() after the backward call.
            # 3.d: periodically update the target network by loading the current Q network weights into the
            #      target_Q network. see state_dict() and load_state_dict() methods.
